Venus: synonym for Victron Energy Unix like distro with a linux kernel

The problematic part with this name is that it is from the Roman
mythology and not as most of our products from the Greek. Phoenix
is already taken though by a charger...

First of all, in general you don't want to rebuild a complete rootfs,
it takes time to compile, lots of diskspace and results in an
image / sdk already provide in binary form.

Anyway, if you insists.. This repo contains some wrapper around
bitbake to fetch, compile sources. For a complete build you need
to have access to private repro of Victron Energy, but generic
images should compile fine without them.

=== For a live image which can be booted from e.g. the sd card ===

# clone this repository with:
git clone https://github.com/victronenergy/venus.git

# fetch needed subtrees
cd venus
make fetch

# don't forget! switch all branches to a correct version, e.g.:
./repos checkout danny_venus

# XXX: make depend would be handy here.. For now just apt-get
# till it stops complaining about missing tools!.

# build all, this will take a while though...
make ve-image

# burn the obatined image to a sd card
gunzip -c deploy/images/ve-image-ccgx.live.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M && sync

The image can be booted by holding the left button on the central pad,
while restarting the ccgx. The login is symply root, without a password
(obviously to be used in a safe environment). To get a console on the LCD
type `modprobe fbcon`.

=== For a complete build ===

# install ssh keys for github / gitlab etc
make fetch-all
./repos checkout danny_venus
make ccgx

Note: repos is just like git submodule foreach -q git,
but shorter, so you can just do:
./repos push origin danny_venus
./repos tag xyz

it will push all, tag all etc. Likewise you can revert to a certain
revision with:

./repos checkout tagname

The repos.conf file contains the repositories which need to be checked
out. It can be rebuild with make repos.conf. metas.whitelist contains
the meta directory which will be added to bblayers.conf, but only if
the are actually present.
