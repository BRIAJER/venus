Venus: synonym for Victron Energy Unix like distro with a linux kernel

The problematic part with this name is that it is from the Roman
mythology and not, as most of our products, from the Greek. Phoenix
is already taken though by a charger...

First of all, make sure you really want to rebuild a complete rootfs,
it takes time to compile, lots of diskspace and results in an
image / sdk which already available anyway, in binary form.

Anyway, if you insist: this repo contains some wrapper functions
around bitbake and git to fetch, and compile sources.

For a complete build (make ccgx) you need to have access to private
repros of Victron Energy. The live image (make ve-image) compiles
fine without them.

Note: repos is just like git submodule foreach -q git, but shorter,
so you can do:

./repos push origin danny_venus
./repos tag xyz

it will push all, tag all etc. Likewise you can revert to a certain
revision with:

./repos checkout tagname

The repos.conf file contains the repositories which need to be checked
out. It can be rebuild with make repos.conf. metas.whitelist contains
the meta directory which will be added to bblayers.conf, but only if
they are actually present.

=== Live image which can be booted from e.g. the sd card ===

# clone this repository with:
git clone https://github.com/victronenergy/venus.git

# fetch needed subtrees
cd venus
make fetch

# don't forget! switch all branches to a correct version, e.g.:
./repos checkout danny_venus

# install host packages (Debian based)
make prereq

# build all, this will take a while though...
make ve-image

# burn the obtained image to a sd card
gunzip -c deploy/images/ve-image-ccgx.live.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M && sync

The image can be booted by holding the left button on the central pad,
while restarting the ccgx (the screen will turn blue for a while when
booting from the card).

To connect to the ccgx, use a modified VE.Direct USB cable and plug it
into VE.Direct port 1 which is the console. Baudrate is 115k2. The login
is simply root, without a password. Obviously to be used only in a safe
environment. For ssh to work a valid passwd must be set first.

=== Complete build ===

# install ssh keys for github / gitlab etc
make fetch-all
./repos checkout danny_venus
make ccgx
